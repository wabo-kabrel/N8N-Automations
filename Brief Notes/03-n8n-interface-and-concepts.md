# Understanding n8n Interface & Core Concepts
## Concept Explanation
n8n is built around a **workflow canvas** where **nodes** are connected to perform tasks. Understanding the interface and core concepts is key before creating complex automations.

## Core Concepts
**1. Workflow**
- A **workflow** is a series of connected nodes that automate tasks.
- Workflows **start with a trigger** and flow through **action nodes.**

**2. Node**
- A node is a **building block** of a workflow.
- Types of nodes:
  - **Trigger Nodes**: Start workflows (e.g., Webhook, Cron).
  - **Action Nodes**: Perform tasks (e.g., send email, update sheet).
  - **Utility Nodes**: Handle data or logic (e.g., Set, Function, Merge).

**3. Connections**
- Nodes are connected by **lines** that represent **data flow**.
- Data passes from one node to another in **JSON format**.
  
**4. Credentials**
- Securely store authentication info for external apps (e.g., Google Sheets, Slack).
- Reusable across workflows.

**5. Execution Panel**
- Displays workflow run results, including successes, errors, and logs.
